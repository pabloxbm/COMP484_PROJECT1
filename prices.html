                    <p>Over the past century, pear prices have shifted due to changes in agriculture, trade, and consumer demand. Early on, local production and seasonal limits made pears less widely available, 
                        but improvements in transportation, refrigeration, and global trade expanded access and stabilized prices. Advances in orchard management and selective breeding increased yields, while 
                        recent demand for specialty and imported varieties, along with climate-related challenges, have caused occasional price fluctuations. Overall, pear prices reflect the combined effects of technology, 
                        markets, and the environment over time.

                    <h3>How Much Has the Price Changed?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Over the past century and especially in recent decades, pear prices have changed noticeably over time, influenced by production costs, transportation, trade, and regional demand which you can see in actual price data. 
                        In the United States, the price per pound of pears at the retail level has climbed from around $0.59 per pound in 1981 to about $2.29 per pound in 2023, reflecting a general upward trend with both rises and occasional dips along the way. 
                        Daily variations have occurred, but overall pears are more expensive now than they were decades ago.

                    <p>
                        On a regional level, prices differ significantly. In North America, consumers commonly pay between $1.50 and $3.00 per pound at retail, with projections suggesting prices rising toward $1.75-$3.25 per pound 
                        because of increased production and demand for organic fruit. In Europe, pears are typically sold in the range of €2.00-€4.00 per kilogram, with expectations of moderate increases as demand for local and organic produce grows. 
                        In parts of Asia, where production volumes are large, prices have generally been lower, often around ¥5-¥10 per kilogram, though they too are expected to rise as demand increases.

                    <p>
                        Different types of pears also command different prices: for example, imported Asian pears often cost more &lang;$4.00-$7.00&rang; per pound because of limited supply, import costs, and specialty market demand. 
                        Meanwhile, more common varieties like Bartlett typically fall in the lower part of the price range due to wider cultivation and greater availability. Over the decades, these shifts illustrate how global markets, transportation, 
                        and consumer preferences for specialty and organic varieties have reshaped pear pricing across regions and types.
