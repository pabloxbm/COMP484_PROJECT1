                    <p>Over the past century, pear prices have shifted due to changes in agriculture, trade, and consumer demand. Early on, local production and seasonal limits made pears less widely available, 
                        but improvements in transportation, refrigeration, and global trade expanded access and stabilized prices. Advances in orchard management and selective breeding increased yields, while 
                        recent demand for specialty and imported varieties, along with climate-related challenges, have caused occasional price fluctuations. Overall, pear prices reflect the combined effects of technology, 
                        markets, and the environment over time.
